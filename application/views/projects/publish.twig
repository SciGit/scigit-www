  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Despite widespread awareness that scientific record and grant funding
  reinforce one another, empirical models of scientific production normally
  consider laboratory inputs to be exogenous. The present article employs a
  cross-section of academic bioscientists to examine the mutual relationship
  between research output and financial support. Information's nonrival
  character is such that scientific output and funding success cannot be
  expressed in strictly supply-and-demand terms. We find the typical bioscience
  laboratory to operate in a range of decreasing returns to scale and to
  over-invest in laboratory equipment and materials. Publication and funding
  success strongly reinforce one another, explaining the right-skewed success
  distributions often observed in science. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis
